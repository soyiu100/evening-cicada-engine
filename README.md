# evening-cicada-engine
## Q&A
### What is this?
An archive for a proof-of-concept (rather extensive PoC) for an unnamed, fusion visual novel engine. Built on [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/), a 2D framework using Lua.  
UPDATE (11/22/2023): A continuation of this is being made, with progress notes under the README of https://github.com/soyiu100/morning-cicada. That new repo will not contain any code, as it is no longer a PoC. 
### ...Does it work?
Yes! If you have LÖVE2D and 7zip installed. Unzip the src.7z in the same directory as the repo (the only folder in the base of the repo should be src/). Then, in a Unix-like shell like [cmder](https://cmder.app/), you can run `sh demo-build`.  
You can also run `sh fast-build` or `love-build.bat` (dry-run Windows script that minifies Lua files) to access the app the normal way (the non-demo build). However, there is not much more to see, unless you want to see story fragments. The demo should pretty much cover every feature that I would like to present.
If my setup is vastly different from yours (e.g. Mac, actual Linux) or you don't want to install anything, a video demo annotated with subtitles can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRTBtYiCauU
### Why are there so many random holes and code fragments floating around? Is it even real?
Admittedly, there are a lot of code bits that don't work or look incomplete. This is a proof-of-concept after all.  
But there are a lot of parts that I intentionally removed post-demo, because I think it's either too cool to post publicly on Github or too bad, e.g. my writing! I'm not a great writer yet, I'm working on it :)  
Other than my writing, things I've removed are: 
- detailed calculations and schema for people
- visuals using funky math, glsl.
- scraped name-related data  

If you want to know more about the visuals, I am willing to talk more about it separately; do reach out if interested! Everything else listed here, not so much.
### This is an archive, not an active repo?
Yes. I'm moving away from Lua/LÖVE2D to something more practical.  
It is a great platform, don't get me wrong. It's good for quick and dirty development, has a really neat and easy built-in graphical library. I'd imagine it's pretty good if you want some small ideas to showcase!  
However, for the benefits that it has, it has a whole lot of overhead. Ironically, I had initially opted to use Lua because I thought the original platform I was using had too much overhead. Now that I've already dealt with it, there's probably not that much of a difference at this point, and I'm confident I can pull myself up by the bootstraps. I'm going back.
